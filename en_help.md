# Adapt built-in scoring systems

A set of standard 3D archery scoring systems is built into the app.

However, because there are so many variations, chances are high you
need different scoring system.

App supports changing some parameters of the built-in scoring systems. 

Try modifying a built-in scoring system to make it fit your needs.

You can adapt any built-in scoring system, but I recommend you
checkout scoring systems named 'Template ...' first. Adapt
these if possible and leave standard systems unchanged.

Modifying scoring system is done from the start screen.

Tap the 'Scoring' button. The **Scoring systems list** screen will open.

Tap on a row for scoring system details. The **Scoring
system details** screen opens.

Apps supports changing the following properties:
- scoring system name

- name of scoring area
- score for scoring area

Tap 'Done' to save your updates, 'Cancel' to discard.

# Restore built-in scoring systems

You can restore built-in scoring systems. This will reset your updates.

Resetting scoring system is done from the start screen.
